    <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
    <p>
      In order to have an official golf handicap within Australia, a golfer is
      required to have a $200 annual Golflink subscription. However many casual
      golfers would like to know their handicaps without having to pay this fee.
      Some golfers may have tried to keep track of their own handicap over time
      however this can sometimes be difficult as there are a number of variables
      involved in the handicap calculation.

    <h2>Solution</h2>
    <p>
      The aim of this web application is to allow casual golfers to track their
      own and their partners handicaps over time. This is done by providing an
      easy to use interface with minimal input required from the user.
    </p>
    <h3>Method of Calculation</h3>
    <p>
      The method used to calculate handicaps is taken from
      <a>https://www.golf.org.au/howtocalculateahandicap</a>. It should be noted
      that since the daily scratch rating of a course is not published I have
      taken the average scratch rating for that course as specified here
